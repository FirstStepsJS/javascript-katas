# JavaScript Katas

JavaScript practice exercises.

## How to run the tests

Make sure you have npm installed and that you have mocha installed globally:

```
npm install -g mocha
```

In the directory of the exercise, run:

```
npm install
mocha tests.js
```

## Fuzzy Time

Write a function that takes a time in a numeric format, such as '13:04', and returns the time as a string spelled out in english, such as 'five after 1'.
